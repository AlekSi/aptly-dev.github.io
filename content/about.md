It really sounds so simple that one can say a lot about his/herself once given a chance but trust me it’s not. When the first time I tried to write down something about me , I was completely lost that from where i should start and where finish. I could manage to write just a few lines only.

If you have already visited here, you must have read something about me. It took me a while to figure out what and how to write something about me. Well here is what I have come up with. It’s not complete of me but still I have tried to tell you about me as much I can in some lines and paragraphs.
