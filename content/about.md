My name is Andrey Smirnov. Currently I'm independent developer. I'm big fan of
Go, Python, DevOps and high-load projects.
I had been working as team development lead at Qik, Skype and Microsoft, my
team was in charge of asynchronous communication backend.
Prior to that I've been leading development of smotri.com, Russian clone
of YouTube. You can find my [resume](http://smira.ru/cv-eng.pdf) to get
more details.

Some my open-source projects are: [Redis Resharding Proxy](https://github.com/smira/redis-resharding-proxy)
and [txZMQ](https://github.com/smira/txZMQ). I've developed
Flash broadcasting backend (smotri.com), call signalling and notification (Qik) and
many other products. I'm frequently giving talks at conferences, long time ago I've been teaching
at Moscow State University.
