aptly publish drop
------------------

    displayed by `aptly publish list`).
-   `endpoint` is publishing endpoint, if not specified, it would
    default to empty endpoint (local file system).
-   `prefix` is an optional prefix for publishing, if not specified,
    prefix is considered to be `.`.

    Removing /var/aptly/public/dists/squeeze-backports...
